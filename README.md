# Zero-Trust Blockchain Identity Framework

A real-time **zero-trust access control system** where every login and resource access
is verified, risk-scored, and immutably logged on a **blockchain ledger**.

This repo contains a monorepo-style structure:

- `frontend/` – React web app
- `backend/` – Node/Express API + zero-trust engine
- `blockchain/` – Solidity smart contracts + Hardhat
- `docs/` – Diagrams and documentation

> NOTE: This is a starter skeleton generated for you. You can modify and extend it.
